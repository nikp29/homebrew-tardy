  caveats <<~EOS
    Tardy is not notarized with Apple.

    If macOS blocks the app on first launch:
      1. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
      2. Click "Open Anyway" next to the Tardy message
      3. Or right-click Tardy.app in /Applications and select "Open"

    Tardy will ask for calendar access on first launch.
    After setup, it runs in your menu bar (calendar icon) and launches automatically on login.
